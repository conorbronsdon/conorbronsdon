## Hey I'm Conor ðŸ‘‹

Most of the time you'll find me organizing and writing, but sometimes you'll find me here doing (bad) self-taught development.

## How'd you start coding?
My first time in a command line was part of a 2007 era high-school project refurbishing PCs for computer labs throughout Latin America, which rapidly involved into making websites for old Runescape clans.
